                                    Dyslexia is a neurological disorder that affects an individual's ability to read and process written language.
                                    It is thought to be caused by difficulties in processing phonological and/or visual information, making it difficult for individuals with dyslexia to recognize and read words.
                                    It is a lifelong condition, but it can be managed with appropriate interventions such as specialized instruction, accommodations, and therapies.

                                Dyscalculia is a learning disorder that affects an individual's ability to understand and use mathematical concepts.
                                It is characterized by difficulties in understanding numbers, learning math facts, and performing mathematical operations.
                                Dyscalculia can also make it hard for people to understand the relationship between numbers and quantities, as well as to learn math concepts.
